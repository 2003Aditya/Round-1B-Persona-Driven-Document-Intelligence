P\u00e9tanque is more than just a game; it's a social \nactivity that brings people together in village squares and parks. The relaxed atmosphere and \nfriendly competition make it a beloved pastime. The Course Camarguaise is a traditional bullfighting sport unique to the Camargue region. Unlike Spanish bullfighting, the objective is not to harm the bull but to remove ribbons and \nother decorations from its horns. The razeteurs, or participants, demonstrate agility and \nbravery as they dodge the bull's charges. The sport is deeply rooted in local culture and is \noften accompanied by music and festivities, particularly in Arles from April to October."
